Front End Developer Technical Exercise

We would like you to create a react application that lists out drivers and menu items from the relevant data files and displays them on the page. The application should make use of react components.
There is a wireframe image included in the ZIP file, suggesting a rough guide to how we would like the page to be laid out. Please feel free to add your own styling to this wireframe the resource is just a guide.
The application should have a header bar, displaying the Logistics UK logo. 
Down the left-hand side of the page, the menu items should be displayed, the data for the menu items sits in the data/menu.json file.
In the main content container, there should be a listing containing; the drivers name, the registration of the vehicle he used and a sum of all the minutes they have spent on activities for the week (1/2/2021 â€“ 7/2/2021). There should also be a box to represent each day of the week. If the driver has a trace for that day with activities, the box should be filled in green, otherwise it can be left clear.
All the data for the listing can be obtained from the data/drivers.json file.
Bonus Tasks:
Add a search box to the page, and upon typing in the input field, the driver list should be filtered down based on matching name, or registration.
Split the total activity time in the listing into totals groups by individual activity types (drive, rest etc...)
Add routing to the application and create holding pages for the menu items.
Upon completion:
Please upload your deliverables (prototypes/source files/solution files, etc.) either to a public repository or zip the files and upload to an online storage account. Please email a link to the files to Peter Connor (pconnor@logistics.org.uk).
Please do not include the node_modules folder with your final solution.
The application should be able to be run from NPM commands.
